-👋 Hi, I’m @katienditu

👀 I’m interested in leveraging data analytics to uncover insights in economic data, improve business strategies, and contribute to evidence-based decision-making processes.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced data visualization techniques and programming languages through Google's Data Analytics Professional Course, deepening my understanding of SQL and R

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects focused on economic research, market analysis, and any innovative initiatives that require data-driven insights to solve complex problems.

📫 How to reach me: You can connect with me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherine-nditu-82b9b5232/  or email me directly at katenditu@gmail.com 
😄 Pronouns: She/Her

⚡ Fun fact: Outside of data analysis, I have a passion for exploring the intersections between economics and sustainable development, and I enjoy unraveling the stories told by data in my quest to contribute to a more equitable world.
